1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Server-side routing means your site handles page routes on the server. The server refreshes the page. A plus is that the only information retrieved is only the information requested. 

Client-side routing means you're internally handling routes to different webpages on your site using Javascript. This method allows for better performance (especially when you have a lot of info being requested) and won't refresh the page.
